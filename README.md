# Birdr

Birdr is a tool for discovering and identifying birds in your neighborhood.
It was built by [Reuben Son](http://reubenson.com/) as a student at
[The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com)
using Ruby/Rails, Javscript, jQuery, AJAX, CSS3, and HTML5.

Bird observation data is obtained through API calls to the
[eBird](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1)
database, which was created in 2002 by the [National Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/)
and the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478)
to log birding checklists submitted provided by birders across the globe.
Information and images specific to each bird species are supplied through AJAX requests
to the Wikipedia API. The responsive design was coded in JavaScript/jQuery and     
CSS from scratch without the use of additional libraries.
